### Install Oxalis-NG Inbound (Server)

Oxalis server comes out of the box with a folder for extensions (named "ext"). 

Start Oxalis server in the normal way, either trough _run.sh_ or _run.bat_.

The easiest way to see that the AS4 endpoint is up and running is to visit its endpoint address.
If we now visit ``localhost:8080/oxalis-ng/as4`` we will be greeted  with the message ``Hello AS4 world``
