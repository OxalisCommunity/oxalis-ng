# Oxalis Document Sniffer (Legacy)

This extension contains functionality provided to help users during introduction of SBDH in OpenPEPPOL.

As the introduction of SBDH is completed, and quite some time has passed, this extension will not receive further updates.
Users may expect this extension and its functionality to be removed from Oxalis as of version 4.2 or 5.0.
