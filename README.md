# Oxalis
[Oxalis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wood_sorrel) is the leading open-source software implementation of OpenPeppol eDelivery Access Point (AS4) specifications. This repository was originally developed by Steinar Overbeck Cook (SendRegning) and later looked after by the Norwegian agency for Public Management and eGovernment (Difi) until March 2020.

Starting November 2020, Oxalis is being maintained by [**NorStella Oxalis Community**](https://www.oxalis.network/).

## Oxalis-NG
Oxalis-NG is latest avatar of Oxalis. Oxalis-NG can be used either as a standalone component or can be integrated as an API component with your backend solution. Oxalis-NG comes with command line standalone component called `oxalis-ng-standalone` which you can use for sending messages. Oxalis-NG also persists inbound messages to the filesystem out of the box. Persistence have been modularized so you can provide your own implementation if you need to send inbound messages to a message queue, a workflow engine, a document archive etc.
